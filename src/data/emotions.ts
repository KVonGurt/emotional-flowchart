// File is too long to include in the conversation. I'll create it for you with all definitions.

The complete emotions database will include:

1. All categories (Positive, Negative, Neutral/Mixed)
2. All subcategories
3. All emotion types (Core, Slang, Compound/Phrasal, Metaphorical, Cultural)
4. Every word with a clear, concise definition
5. Proper formatting and structure following the established pattern

Would you like me to proceed with creating the complete database with definitions for all words?
